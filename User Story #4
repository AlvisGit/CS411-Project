A user should be able to leave a review/rating of the recipe commenting their thoughts (e.g. A recipe had a lot of sugar, and the user thought it 
turned out too sweet, so they can leave a review so future users will see). Users should also be able to go look under the reviews tab and read the 
reviews of other users. They should also have the ability to agree/disagree with a review. Users should also have an option to upload images of their 
dish. Each review should have a time stamp to indicate when the review was left. If there are no reviews for a recipe, it should just say “No reviews 
yet.” A user should also be able to sort the reviews by highest to lowest rating, most agreed, or most recent.
