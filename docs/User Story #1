A user should be able to log in to review previously bought ingredients. Once logged in there should be a previously ordered button directing the user to their previous orders. On this page, they should be able to have an overview of all their orders including the total spent over a given period of time. The user should also be able to place the ingredients of a recent order back into their cart with a click of a button. Then they should be able to edit their cart or place an order on the given grocery marketplace. This allows the user to have a much more efficient process for similar orders.
