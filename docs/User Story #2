The website should have a user-friendly search feature that allows users to input specific 
ingredients they wish to use in a recipe. Upon entering the ingredients in the search bar, 
the user should be able to click the search button and view a list of different recipes 
that contain the input ingredient(s). Additionally, the user should be able to see how many 
ingredients they are missing that are necessary for the recipe. The user should also have 
the option to choose how many different recipes they want to be displayed when searching. 
This feature will help users find relevant recipes based on their preferences and 
ingredients on hand.
