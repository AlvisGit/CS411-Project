Users should be able to input dietary restrictions and preferences to receive recipes that are most suited to them. Such preferences should include budget, allergies, intolerances, required ingredients, cuisine, and more. Users can use these to filter out unwanted recipes. From the search results displayed, if there were missing requirements from the filter, the recipe should display which of the requirements have not been met, such as if there were allergens in the recipe but it matched every other filter requirement. The search results should be displayed in order of how many requirements were met, and if none were met, the user should see a page that says “No search results found”.
