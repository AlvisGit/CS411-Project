A user should be able to change the amount of servings desired. The app should calculate how much of each ingredient is required for each serving input. Then the price
of the ingredients should be updated and displayed. They should also be able to see reviews from other users about whether the portions of the specific dish was filling 
or not filling enough based on the servings made and for how many people. Once the dish is made, the user should be able to add to the review whether the serving sizes 
were accurate or not, and if the dish was filling.
