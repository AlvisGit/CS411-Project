The website should have a personalized feature that allows users to save 
their favorite recipes. If a user finds a recipe they like, they should 
be able to favorite it and access it easily later on. Once the user has 
added recipes to their favorites, they should be able to quickly access 
the recipes saved on the favorites page. Additionally, the user should be 
able to easily access the information page regarding the recipe from the 
favorites page by clicking on the item. This feature will help users keep 
track of their favorite recipes and easily access them whenever they want 
to make the dish.
