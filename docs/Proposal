Proposal 
Our first Idea was to create an app that generates different menu options for 
users based on which ingredients are already in the pantry. By inputting which 
ingredients already owned, the user can be directed to Amazon Groceries to buy 
the remaining ingredients. Additionally, the user will have the option to 
change different portion sizes, where the app would calculate the newly updated
amount of each item required for the recipe based on the serving size. 

The other idea was to create an app to generate a route to a destination while 
utilizing the crime statistics of that certain area. If the userâ€™s shortest path 
includes walking through a neighborhood with a bad history of muggings, attacks,
etc., the app will display a new pathway that avoids that specific area.
