Proposal 
Our first Idea was to create an app that generates different menu options for 
users based on which ingredients are already in the pantry. By inputting which 
ingredients are already owned, the user will be shown multiple recipes that use
the ingredients that they inputted and show how many ingredients are missing. 
The user can then view a recipe to see the ingredients and instructions. 
They will also be shown a YouTube video that shows how to cook the recipe.


The other idea was to create an app to generate a route to a destination while 
utilizing the crime statistics of that certain area. If the userâ€™s shortest path 
includes walking through a neighborhood with a bad history of muggings, attacks,
etc., the app will display a new pathway that avoids that specific area.
