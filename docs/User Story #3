Users should be able to add recipes to their favorites and be able to access it again easily the next time they log in. The navigation bar should have a button to easily
access the Favorites page for the user. Each recipe should have an option to be favorited/saved by the user. Each recipe that was favorited should be added to the user’s 
‘Favorites’ page which will display every recipe saved. Other users should be able to see the favorites page in order to see which dishes someone enjoyed or plans on 
making. If a user does not have any favorites saved, it should display a blank page saying ‘No favorites added yet’.
