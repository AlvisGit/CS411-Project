The website should have a seamless user experience that allows users to easily 
navigate between different pages. For example, when a user clicks a specific 
recipe from the search results page, they should be able to expand the item and 
read more about it. If the user wants to go back to the search results page, 
they should be able to do so by clicking the back button without having to 
re-input the search criteria. This feature will help users save time and effort 
when searching for recipes and exploring the website's different features.
